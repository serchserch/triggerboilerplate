This is a special place where hackers are permitted to make changes,
well, actually only additions, appending their name, date, location,
contact and info as they choose.

So long as you didn't change anything (other than this file) or
take information that would not be available to a regular web
user, we will not take any punitive action against your, and would
like to find out how you got access, so that we can tighten our
security.
